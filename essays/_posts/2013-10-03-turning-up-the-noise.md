title: Turning up the noise
---

With all the scuttlebutt recently about the NSA hacking everyone, with Google and Facebook and basically every other “free” online service selling your personal information to anyone with the slightest interest, you might be wondering what you can do to protect yourself.

The technically sophisticated can do a fair bit, actually. We can set up our own [Diaspora* nodes](https://diaspora.koehn.com/) so that we can control our social network information, we can set up our own [mail](http://postfix.org/) [servers](http://dovecot.org/), thereby avoiding the cloud services of others and avoiding much of the profiling that happens with them.

But what about mom and dad? How can the typical, technologically-unsophisticated user lessen the information known by these behemoths? Well, it turns out, we sophisticates can help.

The thing about these companies and government agencies that makes them so powerful is that to date they’ve had access to an almost perfectly clean stream of information about you: they follow you around the web as you do what you do, and you tell them everything you do with great clarity. Every search you do is something you’re interested in; likewise every page you visit, every friend on Facebook, page you “Like,” every photo you upload. They all give companies and agencies an incredibly detailed profile of who you are, and it costs them almost nothing.

But what if you want to break free of this profile? What if you want to be able to research that subcutaneous lump you just found without your health insurance provider finding out about it? What if you don’t want [your dad to find out you’re pregnant by Target sending you free formula in the mail](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/)?

What you need to do is start messing with the trail of information that you’re leaving behind. Dirtying it up a bit so that nobody watching can tell what stuff you’re really interested in, and what stuff is just noise.

What if you installed a simple browser plugin that would randomly surf around on the web, carrying your profile on an endless, wild goose chase? It could put random stuff into Google, follow its search results to various pages, spend some time there, follow a few links, and move on. It would be easy to do this in a way that would be impossible for Google to know that it wasn’t really you.

You can apply this technique for every service you use: online retailers like Amazon and Target, social networks (tag random people as you, “Like” random pages/tweets). The marketing groups will have a completely averaged view of who the real you really is: are you young? Old? Conservative? Liberal? Sick? Athletic? Drug user? Gun lover?

At a more technical level, it’s easy to envision an application that blasts random bits across the internet, in a way that looks a lot like file sharing, or typing, or voice/video chat. But if it’s just random bits (or random bits over a known protocol), you can just imagine the NSA tying itself into knots trying to decipher your secret message. If you used well-known ports it would be even better. The more people that do this, the lower the value of the information going over the wire in the first place, and the less value that can be derived from it.

The point of all of this is that we can have some control over the image we project online. We just have to stop playing the game the way we have been: we need to take ownership of our identities and stop passively giving them away.
