So the server I bought has an IP address that is pointed to by dozens if not hundreds of domain names. I got sick of my server getting pounded by things, so I added a <code>mod_rewrite</code> rule that tells the various bots that not only is the content they're looking for not there, but it will <b>never</b> be there, ever (410).  <br /><pre>  RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^diaspora\.koehn\.com$<br />  RewriteRule ^.*$ - [G]<br /></pre>Now the ruby code doesn't have to be awakened.
