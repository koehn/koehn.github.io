title: AC-3, Turbo Mode, and performance
---

Sure enough, hooking my Pi up to a receiver capable of doing the AC-3 (aka Dolby Digital) decoding solved many of my problems. But not all. For reasons I can't quite understand there are still pauses in video... sometimes. Sometimes videos play fine, but eventually they seem to either freeze or have the monitor drop out while the audio keeps playing just fine. I'm at a bit of a loss to figure this out; it could even be a bad HDMI cable for all I know. The tough part is I'm not even sure how to troubleshoot the problem.

I've engaged Turbo Mode on the Pi, clocking the CPU to 1 GHz, and some other speeds higher as well as cranking the voltage to 6V. Honestly I don't think it's made much difference, leaving me to wonder what else I can do to improve performance.

Too many mysteries and I'm too sleepy to do any more messing with the device. Good night.
