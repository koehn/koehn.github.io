I decided to finally commit to getting my blog off of Blogger and onto Jekyll. There are 
a number of advantages:

* It’s not Google
* I have nearly infinite control over what my content looks like
* It’s far easier to write Markdown than it is to write HTML

So I followed the [Instructions](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) and 
[migrated](http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/rss/) from my RSS feed. Then I used an 
[HTML to Markdown converter](https://domchristie.github.io/to-markdown/) which cleaned 
up the migrated posts a lot, and did the final cleanup by hand. Writing blog entries has 
never been so easy!
