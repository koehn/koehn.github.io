I wrote a simple little script to scan Junk folders and Inboxes looking for viruses. 
Why, since Amavis already scans incoming emails? Because often times the 
definitions for the viruses come in after the mail has already been delivered. 

It also saves me problems when the messages get downloaded to a mail client running on 
a machine with anti-virus software, since it reports said machine is infected with a 
virus. 

It's here in [Gitlab Snitppets](https://gitlab.koehn.com/snippets/9).
